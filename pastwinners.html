            <h5> An Interview </h5>
            &nbsp;

            <p class="question"> 1.) If you were to promote Noteworthy to a prospective contestant, how would you describe the experience? </p>


            <p class="may"> May: It's a rollercoaster ride. It takes a certain kind of courage and open-mindedness to be up there to perform your own song, and that's what makes it really thrilling. But you will also know that the audience is there because they're thrilled to discover new music and to discover a new side of you. It will be an inspiring experience for everyone involved. </p>

            <p class="gnes"> Gnesyer: A safe platform, safe and supportive environment to present your original work. It's a great performing experience. Honestly though, quite nerve-wracking as you are presenting original work and it's that sense you're in a vulnerable and emotionally exposing position. </p>


            <p class="question"> 2.) Can you provide any song theme ideas for contestants that have writers block? What were some of the more effective themes from last year in your opinion? (Story based, protest, duet etc.) </p>

            <p class="may"> May: LOVE seems to be the centre of most songs last year haha. Growing up is another big one. But ultimately, write about what is killing you, and what is keeping you alive. Be painfully honest. Whenever I get stuck, I ask myself, 'how can I be more honest?' and it'll get easier and easier from there.</p>

            <p class="gnes"> Gnesyer: Writer's block = listen to other songs that you wouldn't listen to as well as the ones you do - you get a range and inspiration that way. 

                Theme ideas - love is always easy to write about. I think if you're having writer's block and you're trying to think about some song theme ideas = take a well known narrative, and put a twist on it. Last year, the most obscure ones definitely caught attention and therefore were most effective in my opinion. Ones that told a linear story/narrative was also effective. </p>


            <p class="question"> 3.) Whatâ€™s the most valuable thing you learned from Noteworthy 2017? </p>

            <p class="may"> May: That music can connect people to an incredibly large extent. I was singing about an intense sense of loneliness, and people were responding. I could feel everyone in the auditorium getting ever so slightly closer as the night went on, because every single songwriter was making something beautiful, something higher than themselves; although we all have different musical tastes, one thing we all have in common, and the reason why we turn to music, is that we want something more from this life. And I realised last year at Noteworthy, looking around the auditorium, that music gives us precisely that tangible 'something else'.</p> 

            <p class="gnes"> Gnesyer: That my music is actually alright and that people want to hear stories. </p>


            <p class="question"> 4.) Can you provide any tips or tricks for new contestants? (writing techniques, time management, live performance tips etc.) </p>

            <p class="may"> May: Step 1: Learn from everyone and everything. YouTube videos, live performances, a particular detail that a performer does, a specific chord progression that works... Take note of everything.

                Step 2: Forget half of it. Engage yourself completely, whether it's songwriting or performing, let the music envelope you, let it move you (emotionally and physically!), and your musical individuality will show itself.</p>

            <p class="gnes"> Gnesyer: Write the stories you want to share, or would want to hear. Time management is important - especially if you want to enter, allot time for peer feedback as well - feedback is really helpful. Performing - just do your own thing, and do it confidently. The beauty about music and the arts is that there is no right answer, so you do you.</p>
