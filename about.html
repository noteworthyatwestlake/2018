    <h5> About Noteworthy </h5>
    <p class="abouttext"> Established as an offical Westlake competition in 2017, Noteworthy was a concept brought to fruition based on the notion that something that is seen as one of the most intimidating art forms - orignial music, could be used as a medium to celebrate the diversity of all the performing arts. Mrs Katja Konings, a teacher in the music department of Westlake Girls, facilitated most of the contest, and in her attention to detail, and hard work, created an environment where artists of all genres, Musicians, Dancers, Film makers, Choreographers and more, could come together, and not only enjoy, but celebrate the hard work of their peers in a showcase, none would soon forget. In 2018, the team intends to further extend the hand of acceptance into orignial music as a medium to reach a wider audience, and in doing so, continue the legacy of Noteworthy for many years to come. </p>
